What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Continuing COMP4300.  Enjoying the refresher on C++ modern day style.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* The family is sick today, and I am 'wearing the black' and sat on the wall,
  sentinel for my family.  Caretaking everyone and pretty weary and bleary.
* It would be easier, maybe if every one of the kids were sick, but the older two 
  are bright eyed and bushy tailed painting the walls with their energy.
* Looking forward to putting the COMP4300 into practice and begin building the
  game engine from scratch.  It's going to be put together in the ECS style.  That's
  Entity_component_system structure.
* Look into these as other patterns for game design used in conjunction or instead of ECS.
  
  - Component-based pattern.
  - Message Bus pattern
  - Game loop pattern
  - spatial partition pattern
  - state machine pattern 
  - resource pool pattern
  - plugin pattern 
  - dirty flag pattern
