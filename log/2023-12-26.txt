What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Continuing the course.
* Mostly a family day.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* I don't hate c++.
* I can understand, given that there's many ways to do the same thing, that it could
  be difficult to read someone else's code potentially if they do not follow
  conventions of modern c++ or override defaults, etc.  Would take longer to sus out.
