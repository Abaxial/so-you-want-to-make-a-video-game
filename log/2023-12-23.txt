What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Started digesting content about game designer as a role.
* Started summarizing findings on game designer role.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* How best to structure researched information?  Miro is good for visual organization of data.
* Github is good for textual data.
* Jira is good for refined use of data to task out and roadmap / backlog plan.
* Confluence for distilled information once flowed through github, miro, youtube.
* Share learnings at some cadence.  Youtube?  Podcast? Blog? All?
* What cadence?
* Boost engagement. Tier list videos.
* Dev videos.
