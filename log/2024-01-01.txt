What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Not as much as I'd like, and mostly passive.
* I wanted to dig into an online distraction but instead have wrested myself away
  so as to get some quality sleep in the service of mental health. yay me.
* Also been continuing to watch material on game development and design.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* My brain is too foggy to dump its contents right now.
