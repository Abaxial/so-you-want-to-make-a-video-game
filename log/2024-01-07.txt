What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Begun lecture 4 of 20 from the university course.  Now we're digging into the
  beginnings of the work.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* I always want to do more.
* I want to write a novel too.  That's a feat in itself.  Trying to focus just on
  my current objectives of video game design.
* Writing focus can wait until after the summer.  October.  Some mild research.
* Don't cut off the daemon, but capture the epifanies and let the distraction
  float by like fireflies on a summer's eve.
