What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Moved on to next lecture.
* Did not let the inertia of a week with a sick family drag me down into the void.
* It's still C++ pointers and learnings in this lecture.  Wrapping up though.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* It ocurred to me today that much of my creative endeavour in life has been on
  the back of something that exists.  That is, I like to work within a landscape.
  Within the nature and shape of wherever I am.  I'll probably expand more on this 
  but today I made the connection that I even play video games in such a way.
  In minecraft, I am one that tends to half sculpt what I build into the natural 
  landscape that exists, and then expand on that.  

  In my earlier years I would use the clip-art libraries that would come with 
  microsoft word, but I'd use multiple ones, ungroup the shapes used to compose them
  and then stitch them back together into whatever I wanted.

  I appreciate the constraint and limitation of choice when working in this way, maybe.

  So how can I continue to leverage and showcase that aspect of myself without feeling
  guilty or feeling like it's not enough?

  How can I use that comfort/aspect of myself to my best advantage to achieve the goals
  I have set forth?
