What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* This is the lecture I'm working through currently:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_mgIDWpbms&t=1660s
* It's just refreshing me on c++, which given how far it's come is more like
  my learning it for the first time.  It doesn't seem as verbose as once it was
  and as I understand it it's just more modernized.
* Incidentally, the system/style of the lecture outputs is an Entity Component system.
* [TODO] Look into other styles of systems for game design/development.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* I think I'm going to enjoy this lecture series and the 'projects' included.  
  I think the split I should go through for now is 60% of the time lecturing
  and 40% of my time planning / researching / mapping out roles for now.
