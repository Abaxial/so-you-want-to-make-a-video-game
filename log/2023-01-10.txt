What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Nothing today but coming here to report it was nothing today.
  And that's something. It was a small thing I didn't want to do and I did it.
  A bucket of water can be measured in drops.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* In addition to the revelation I had about how I like to mold to the landscape.
  I also have another character trait that I think I should learn to leverage to it's best advantage.
  I am my sharpest and best when operating from a disadvantage.
  In chess, I've always played my best game when backed into a corner.
  I'm also competitive, but have somehow conditioned myself to not care about that most of the time.
* So, there's some more tools in the toolbelt to leverage.
