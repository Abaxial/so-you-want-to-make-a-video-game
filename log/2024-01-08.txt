What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Lecture 4 mostly completed.
* Began digging into SFML for 'assignment 1'.
* SFML is a graphics library for c++ which we'll be making use of during this course.
* Assignment 1 just has to do with flexing some of the SFML features to make shapes
  and have the shapes flying around the screen with text attached.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* Today was a hard day.  Not in this stuff, but in everything else stuff.  Life stuff.
  
  One foot. And then the other.
