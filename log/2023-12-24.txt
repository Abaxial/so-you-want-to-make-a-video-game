What have I done today to move myself towards my goal?

* Began to go through the shared lectures from COMP4300 - C++ Game Programming
  The instructor is fantastic, it's using modern C++ which is common in the game 
  industry, through the course it teaches a particular pattern of game design
  and part of the course is building a game engine in C++.  This feels meaty,
  but should help keep the practical side of my endeavour moving forward.  

* On that end, I was thinking yesterday that I need to keep doing something practical
  every week.  I can't just research and analyse and write my summaries and learning.
  Yes it's all good that I want to build a pipeline for sharing my journey
  but I actually need to take some steps on the journey and not just compile
  information.  This will be a good first step in that direction.  Not using
  any particular game engine, but building my own in C++.

Brain Dump (Kick it forward)

* It's Christmas eve.  Having set up my C++ environment and watched/listened to 
  the first few lectures is good enough for today.  Time for some more time with
  the family and friends.  

  To all those celebrating holidays with family and friends this weekend, and
  to all those not: may your next couple of days be in peace and calm.
